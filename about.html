My name is Mitchell. I am 30 years old, I am and Australian born in Adelaide. As far as culture goes my great grandmother is aboriginal, But other then that i am Australian<br>
I quite like learning about the aboriginal culture, Especially about "the dreaming".<br>
I have a certificate I&II in it from Charles Darwin University. Other that that i was enrolled in a bachelor in IT course online.<br>
However the service was so bad that I decided to quit and wait till online learning had improved. I know quite a bit of the Japanese language as i have always been fascinated by their culture.<br>
I enjoy making things. Whether it is with my hands, Or digital in a game. I like to create and solve problems.
