<h2>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h2>

<p>

I have a very logical way of thinking, I am good at leadership and guiding others.<br>
I am confident in my abilities, And often think outside the box. I learn by doing by doing, And tinkering.<br>
I have a hard time learning by reading or listening, And need to interact to learn.

</p>

<h2>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>

<p>

I think i would work well as a team. I am good at organizing and encouraging others.<br>
I can help to keep structure, And motivate people do the best they can.<br>
I can solve help disputes and keep people on track. I can delegate responsibilities and improve group efficiency.

</p>

<h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>

<p>

I am aware of my limitation and drawbacks, And can see how other would compliment the team.<br>
I would look at each person and see how they would best contribute to the team, And in what way<br>
I understand the different opinions can cause conflict. But people of differing opinions can see things other cannot.<br>
As such i would assemble a team that different personalties and styles and delegate them to their best roles.<br>
