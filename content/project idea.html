<h1> Project Ideas </h1><br>

<h1>Windows program and setting profiler</h1><br>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>

My project idea is for a windows program and setting profiler. To help automate and make it easier when people need to reinstall windows or get a new PC<br>
It will create and store a profile of setting and programs that the user can use if they need to reinstall windows.<br>
It can be stored locally or can be linked to an account, Such as Microsoft account or a google account<br>
I will have a nice interface, And no technical knowledge will be necessary.<br>
The program will use already existing windows install automation tools. And the tool will be open source and free.

</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>

There are roughly 1.4 Billion Windows 10 & 11 users Alone. And if every person owns 5 computers in their lifetime, Or need to reinstall Windows,<br>
That equals alot of time and money spent on windows reinstallations. PC manufacturers often install a lot of their own software onto the computer.<br>
This can slow down the computer and take up unnecessary space. It is often to difficult or time consuming for the average user to reinstall Windows<br>
This tool can automate the installation of windows, User settings, And user software. Bringing down the time needed and the complexity of a windows reinstall.<br>
So i think this tool would be of use to the majority of user. Both average users and the more advanced user, That may reinstall windows many times.

</p>

<h2>Description</h2>


<p>
This program will help with the setup of a new Windows device, Or help with the reinstallation of an existing Windows install.<br>
It will leverage already existing features tools tools, Often used by system administrators to install Windows in a pre configured fashion.<br>
The program will allow for the easy setup of low powered devices. Where a low power profile is selected, The program will then change settings and feature for use with low powered devices.<br>
When changing a setting or installing a program, The tool will ask the user if they wish to add them to their profile. The profile will grow as the user continues to uses Windows.<br>
This program Will store the profile either on the device locally, Or encrypted on a remote platform.<br>
The profile can be linked to a new or existing account, Such as a Google account or a Microsoft account.<br>
The tool would not need a username and password. Instead it would allow for the login of a 3rd party account. It will then download the profile from the secure server.<br>
If the user ever needs to reinstall Windows, Or buys a new computer. They can get back to where they were quicker, Reducing time lost.<br>
The program will not need the user to know any complex steps or use any commands. The user will not have to create batch files or windows unattended install file.<br>
The program will have a GUI, With tabs for programs and settings stored on the profile. It will also include a hardware tab, For different PC's and configurations.<br>
The profile can store Windows device driver so that the user will not have to source these from device vendors or manufacturers.<br>
The program will function similar to the existing product <a href="https://ninite.com">Ninite</a>. Once launched you can then select all programs and settings, or select them individually.<br>
The program could also have a boot component. When the program boots before a windows installation, where a profile is selected.<br>
Once selected it will download all the required programs and settings. And installs them automaticity after the windows install is completed.<br>
Using the existing Windows unattended install feature. The install of programs and setting is done in the background without the user needing to do anything.<br>
This allows for an inexperienced or non "tech savvy" users, To do something that would otherwise require the user to learn the use of professional skills and tools.<br>
All programs will be downloaded from their respected websites. This will ensure the user had the most up to date versions.<br>
The program may also include parental lock features. Parents or guardians can create a profile for their kids, Allowing only approved programs to be installed.<br>
The program could include import and export features. Allowing the user to share his programs and settings, To existing users, Or to create a template for new users.<br>
The boot component could also include the ability for network installation. Where multiple PC's on the same network can be setup with the same profile simultaneously using pxe booting.<br>

</p>

<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>

<p>

A the tool is a simple one it would require very little in the way dedicated hardware.<br>
The tool would require very little in the way of user hardware. Only a Windows pc and an internet connection is required.<br>
The server would have to be a database, Using software like <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">myqsl</a> for user id's. And a simple file server using https or ftp (for example) for the download of files<br>
The authentication would be done by logging into the associated 3rd party account. That account id would then match one on the database.<br>
The tool could be coded in something like C++ using <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Visual Studio.</a> Or java using <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/">Java Development Kit</a> (for example).<br>
The file download would need to be encrypted, Using something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a> or <a href="https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/rsa-encryption-decryption#:~:text=RSA(Rivest%2DShamir%2DAdleman,to%20decrypt%20the%20encrypted%20message.">RSA</a>.<br>

</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>

<p>

If this tool is successful It could potentially change the way we reinstall Windows. Streamlining the process for the inexperienced.<br>
And allowing the reinstallation of Windows with minimal time lost, And no need for the average user to learn complex skills and tools.<br>
It also had the potential to replace the way businesses and educational services roll out Windows installs.<br> 
Billions of Windows user will no longer have the tedious task of reinstalling all programs, And changing all setting to get their Windows pc back to how they want it.<br>
Allowing the daunting task of reinstalling Windows to be easy and hassle free<br>
