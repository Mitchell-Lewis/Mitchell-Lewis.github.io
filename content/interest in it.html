<h1> Interest in IT </h1>

<p>

I have been interested in IT and computers for as long as i can remember. As a kid I was fascinated by anything computerized,<br>
Even the most basic computerized printer, Camera or Communicated device could hold my attention for longer that i care to admit.<br>
Being in primary school during the 2000's, There was a lot of change In IT, And especial in regards to the internet<br>
This sparked my interest in networking and what made this all work. We were taught on how to use the internet and this only furled my interest.<br>
In high school i opted to do a lot of my work on computers, As such i got to know the IT admin well. He was the one that really got me thinking about a career in IT.<br>

I chose RMIT as it offers a lot of flexibility in the courses, Which is great as due to my chronic insomnia my waking hours are erratic.<br>
This allows me to study at my own pace. As a traditional uni requires you to study on campus. This would be impossible with my insomnia.<br>
Studying with RMIT allows me to study at night, When there is not much to do. And allows me to be productive even when my sleep is not ideal.<br>

</p>

<p>

I expect to learn not only The skills required to gain employment in IT. But but also gain other crucial skills in the process.<br>
I found my typing skills have been lacking and this course gives me an opportunity to brush up on them.<br>
My insomnia has made planning things a struggle. Studying at RMIT has giving me the opportunity to help me learn time management and planning skills.
